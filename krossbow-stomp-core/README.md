# Krossbow STOMP Core

This is the core module of Krossbow, which provides a pure-Kotlin (multiplatform) STOMP protocol implementation.

It depends on `krossbow-websocket-core` for the definition of a general websocket interface.
 
The major types you can use from this module are `StompClient` and `StompSession`.
