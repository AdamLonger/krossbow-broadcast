# Krossbow Web Socket OkHttp

This is a JVM implementation of the general Web Socket interface defined by `krossbow-websocket-core`, adapting 
[OkHttp's `WebSocket`](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-web-socket/).

This makes it a convenient choice when already using OkHttp as an HTTP client, which is quite popular on Android.
